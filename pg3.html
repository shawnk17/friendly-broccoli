            <h1>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</h1>
            <p>Thank you, steal again. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.
                Inflammable means flammable? What a country. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</p>
            <p>And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Stan Lee never left.
                <strong> I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</strong>
                <em> I'll be back.</em> You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm
                back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
            <h2>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</h2>
            <p>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! What good is money if
                it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether
                you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some
                    Confidence, Stupid!"</li>
                <li>Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.</li>
                <li>But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my
                    life.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die.</h3>
            <p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides
                occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Save me, Jeebus.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</li>
                <li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
                <li>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. How could you?! Haven't you learned
                anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws!
                Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing,
                did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah!
                Stay out of my booze.</p>
            <p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
                Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the
                dark.</p>
            <p>Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Old people don't
                need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have
                that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
            <p>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them. I'm normally not a praying
                man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Homer no function beer well without.</p>
            <p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some
                old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? Bart,
                with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</p>
            <p>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. You
                know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</p>
            <p>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching
                someone in the dark. I was saying "Boo-urns." Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!</p>
            <p>You don't win friends with salad. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about
                it. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>
            <p>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. When I held that gun
                in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Fat Tony is a cancer on this
                fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</p>
            <p>Save me, Jeebus. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're
                on TV! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay
                if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
            <p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Uh, no,
                they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over
                his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</p>
